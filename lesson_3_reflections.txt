When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	Remote repositories are useful anytime you are working with someone else on a project, 
	are working on multiple computers, 
	or you could even use the remote repository as a back up.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would want to control when changes are pulled from the remote.  
    If someone else makes changes to the remote, and I'm working on the same files locally, I don't want my local repository to be updated with someone else's changes.
